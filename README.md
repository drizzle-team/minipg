A minimal, dependency-free PostgreSQL driver for Node, Bun, Deno, and Cloudflare Workers. It
covers the wire protocol directly and ships as ESM only, with 13 subpath entry points for
each supported runtime and adapter.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @drizzle-team/minipg
```

```bash
npm install @drizzle-team/minipg
```

```bash
bun add @drizzle-team/minipg
```

## Usage

The example below queries a local cluster. From a checkout of this repo, provision one with:

```bash
bun run test:setup
```

That starts Postgres on `127.0.0.1:54329` with a `testdb` database and a seeded table `t`.
Any other Postgres works too — point the config below at it.

```js
import { connect } from '@drizzle-team/minipg'

const db = await connect({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 54329,
  user: 'postgres',
  password: 'postgres',
  database: 'testdb',
})

const result = await db.query('select id, name, n8, amount from t order by id')
console.log(result.rows)

await db.end()
```

`n8` (bigint) comes back as a native JS `BigInt`, and `amount` (numeric) comes back as a
string, since both types can exceed the range a JS number can represent without losing
precision.

Built-in array columns (`int4[]`, `text[]`, `jsonb[]`, `timestamptz[]`, …) decode to JS
arrays, with each element following the scalar rules above — so `int8[]` yields `BigInt`s
and `numeric[]` yields exact strings. Arrays whose element type has a per-database OID
(`enum[]`, `domain[]`, composite arrays) can't be recognised from the wire OID alone and
still arrive as the raw `{…}` literal; declare a `shape` for those. To opt back out for a
given type, override its array OID in `types` (e.g. `types: { 1007: (b) => b.toString() }`).
